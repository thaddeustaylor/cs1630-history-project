			<p>The Herodotus Data Repository and Analysis System project aims to generate a simple, straightforward way for researchers to submit data, query data, and perform data analysis across multiple dimensions of information. In order to do this, our project aims to employ a specific submission protocol to ensure clean, consistent data to allow for data analysis. Additionally, our system aims to provide tools for visual data analysis and for handling conflicts in the domains of time and space, so that researchers may successfully merge datasets in order to study the relationships between many separate domains of data over time. </p>

			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>The World-historical Data project addresses the need for comprehensive historical data on the human experience at the global level. Creation of large-scale, long-term, comprehensive databases will make it possible to extend our knowledge of current global and local patterns (based on systematic reporting and recording since about 1950) back by as much as five centuries. If successful, such an effort will make it possible to get beyond our current reliance on short-term and localized studies of social change and to understand long-term and global patterns in economics, social life, health, and environmental conditions. This proposal requests to format and link datasets in economic and demographic history, enabling users of the system to assemble and analyze datasets created by "federation" of archived datasets. The final product for this stage of the project will enable users to select, combine, and analyze datasets relevant to global historical processes, one focusing on pre-1950 data drawn from a local Archive, and the other focusing on post-1950 data drawn from major international organizations. We would like to complete a series of prototypes permitting sophisticated comparison of datasets Project activities will focus on the creation and display of comparative prototypes in three areas: a Portal to online datasets; an Archive of datasets on the Data; and, in our principal innovation, the linking or federation of datasets to enable users to create and analyze expanded datasets. For work at this stage, the project will give particular attention to economic and demographic data, and will focus methodologically on application of GIS methods to ensure that all data are identified spatially. At the end of the proposed Digital Start-up Grant period, the module will be available for wide usage in the retrieval, federation, and analysis of economic and demographic data addressing all regions of the world and long time periods. The project will also be ready to enter its later stages of work. </p>
